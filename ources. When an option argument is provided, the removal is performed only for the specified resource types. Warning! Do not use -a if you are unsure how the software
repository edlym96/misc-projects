       iippccrrmm  removes  System  V  inter-process communication (IPC) objects and associated data structures from the system.  In order to delete such objects, you must be superuser, or the creator or
       owner of the object.

       System V IPC objects are of three types: shared memory, message queues, and semaphores.  Deletion of a message queue or semaphore object is immediate (regardless of whether any process  still
       holds an IPC identifier for the object).  A shared memory object is only removed after all currently attached processes have detached (sshhmmddtt(2)) the object from their virtual address space.

       Two  syntax  styles are supported.  The old Linux historical syntax specifies a three-letter keyword indicating which class of object is to be deleted, followed by one or more IPC identifiers
       for objects of this type.

       The SUS-compliant syntax allows the specification of zero or more objects of all three types in a single command line, with objects specified either by key or by identifier (see below).  Both
       keys and identifiers may be specified in decimal, hexadecimal (specified with an initial '0x' or '0X'), or octal (specified with an initial '0').

       The details of the removes are described in sshhmmccttll(2), mmssggccttll(2), and sseemmccttll(2).  The identifiers and keys can be found by using iippccss(1).

       In its first Linux implementation, iippccrrmm used the deprecated syntax shown in the second line of the SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS.  Functionality present in other *nix implementations  of  iippccrrmm  has  since  been
       added, namely the ability to delete resources by key (not just identifier), and to respect the same command-line syntax.  For backward compatibility the previous syntax is still supported.
